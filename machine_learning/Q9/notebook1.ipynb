    "# Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "A cyber security agent wants to check the Microsoft Malware so need he came\n",
    "to you as a Machine learning Engineering with Data, You need to find the Malwareusing a supervised algorithm and you need to find the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict a** Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware**, based on different properties of that machine. The telemetry data containing these properties and the machine infections was generated by combining heartbeat and threat reports collected by Microsoft's endpoint protection solution, Windows Defender.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a MachineIdentifier. HasDetections is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine. Using the information and labels in train.csv, you must predict the value for HasDetections for each machine in test.csv."
